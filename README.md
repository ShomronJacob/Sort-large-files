# Sort-large-files
This code deals with implementing a sorting technique that takes large files and sorts them. The way this code is written, it automatically generates the large file of specified size, breaks it into chunks, sorts each chunk, merges them to form one final sorted file of the same size. For more information on how it is implemented and how to run the code, check the readme file.
